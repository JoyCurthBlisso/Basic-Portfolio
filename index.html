    My name is Joy Curth.  I'm IT Manager & Entrepreneur.  I have had a tech corporate career for 18 years and also own a business.  I love to travel and wellness.  I have combined these passions by starting a healing tea and apothecary shop in Portsmouth, NH.  After becoming an aromatherapist and herbalist, and Ayurvedic consultant, I have learned the power of how we can heal ourselves naturally.  There are many modalities we can heal ourselves with such as yoga, pilates, reiki and flower essences as well.  

    I grew up in NH but left 8 years ago to move to Sydney, Australia.  From there I moved to San Diego for 4 years, but have just relocated back to the seacoast.  My intention is to be able to live in all 3 places, 4 mos a year each...
